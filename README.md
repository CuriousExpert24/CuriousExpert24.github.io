# CuriousExpert24 Portfolio Page

This repository is used to host my portfolio, which can be found in this url: https://curiousexpert24.github.io/ (Published using GitHub Pages)

The website isn't fully done, with minor changes that I need to make in order to make this a complete portfolio. But, this is what I currently have in my portfolio:
1. My Code Projects (mostly websites)
2. My Medium Profile (where I write blog posts about technology, especially AI)
3. My Github Profile (which has all the repositories listed in my portfolio)
4. and many more ....

Thank you so much for visiting my website and I hope that these projects I have made inspired you to write more code
